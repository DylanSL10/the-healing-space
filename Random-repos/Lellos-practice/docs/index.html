            Are you feeling overwhelmed by depression, anxiety, or lifeâ€™s
            challenges? Maybe you often feel down, worried about the future, and
            find it hard to enjoy the things you once did. You want to feel
            heard, regain a sense of control, and discover purposeâ€”not just
            survive, but truly live. Youâ€™re looking for support from someone who
            meets you where you are, without judgment. Together, weâ€™ll navigate
            these struggles and help you reconnect with your confidence and
            inner strength.

          <h2>My Approach</h2>
          <p>
            Iâ€™ve worked in the mental health field for over 15 years, and since
            2020, Iâ€™ve been serving the Carson City community. I offer a safe,
            supportive space where you can express yourself openly and feel
            truly heard. Through understanding your unique story, I help you
            uncover your strengths and develop practical tools to manage
            emotions and navigate lifeâ€™s challenges with resilience. My approach
            to therapy is about empowermentâ€”helping you live the meaningful,
            fulfilling life you deserve.
          </p>
          <p>
            I bring my authentic self into our sessions and often use humor to
            help create a comfortable, trusting space. Iâ€™ll be open with you
            about your diagnosis and the therapeutic techniques weâ€™ll use, so
            you stay informed and actively involved in your own treatment.
