            Are you feeling overwhelmed by depression, anxiety, or life’s
            challenges? Maybe you often feel down, worried about the future, and
            find it hard to enjoy the things you once did. You want to feel
            heard, regain a sense of control, and discover purpose—not just to
            survive, but truly live. You’re looking for support from someone who
            meets you where you are, without judgment. Together, we’ll navigate
            these struggles and help you reconnect with your confidence and
            inner strength.

          <h2>My Approach</h2>
          <p>
            I’ve worked in the mental health field for over 15 years, and since
            2020, I’ve been serving the Carson City community. I offer a safe,
            supportive space where you can express yourself openly and feel
            truly heard. Through understanding your unique story, I help you
            uncover your strengths and develop practical tools to manage
            emotions and navigate life’s challenges with resilience. My approach
            to therapy is about empowerment—helping you live the meaningful,
            fulfilling life you deserve.
          </p>
          <p>
            I bring my authentic self into our sessions and often use humor to
            help create a comfortable, trusting space. I’ll be open with you
            about your diagnosis and the therapeutic techniques we’ll use, so
            you stay informed and actively involved in your own treatment.
